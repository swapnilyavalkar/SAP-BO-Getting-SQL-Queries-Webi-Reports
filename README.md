# üåü SAP BusinessObjects Report Query Extraction Script üåü

Welcome to the **SAP BusinessObjects Report Query Extraction Script**! This Java-based Script is designed to help you log in to a SAP BusinessObjects (BO) server, retrieve queries from reports, and save them to text files. The tool supports both Freehand SQL (FHSQL) and Universe-based reports.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before you start using this Script, ensure you have the following:

- **Java JDK**: Installed on your machine.
- **Maven/Gradle**: For managing dependencies, if not included manually.
- **OkHttp**: For making HTTP requests.
- **JSON & XML**: Libraries for JSON/XML processing.

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swapnilyavalkar/SAP-BO-Getting-SQL-Queries-Webi-Reports.git
cd SAP-BO-Getting-SQL-Queries-Webi-Reports
```

### 2. Add Dependencies
Ensure that your project includes the following dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp3</groupId>
        <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>
        <version>4.9.3</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.json</groupId>
        <artifactId>json</artifactId>
        <version>20211205</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### 3. Configuration
Update the `MainProgram.java` class with your **CMS IP**, **username**, **password**, and **report ID**:

```java
public static String SOURCE_CMS_IP = "Your_CMS_IP";
public static String SOURCE_CMS_USN = "Your_Username";
public static String SOURCE_CMS_PWD = "Your_Password";
public static String SOURCE_REPORT_ID = "Your_Report_ID"; //You can also mention multiple SI_IDs of the reports as {"760528", "478278"}
```

## üí° How It Works

This Script follows these main steps:

1. **Log in to the BO Server**: Authenticates the user with the BO server and retrieves a session token.
2. **Retrieve Data Providers**: Extracts the list of data providers (queries) from a given report.
3. **Save Queries to Files**: Depending on the data source type (FHSQL or Universe), the corresponding query is saved to a `.txt` file.
4. **Log off from the Server**: Logs out from the BO server, invalidating the session token.

## üéÆ Usage

### 1. Log in to the Server
The `logonServer()` method logs you into the BO server and retrieves a session token:

```java
String token = Util.logonServer(SOURCE_CMS_IP, SOURCE_CMS_PWD);
```

### 2. Retrieve and Save Queries
Call the `getQueries()` method with the report ID and session token:

```java
Util.getQueries(SOURCE_REPORT_ID, token, reportName);
```
This will save the queries into text files in the current directory.

### 3. Log off from the Server
Finally, log off from the server:

```java
Util.logoffServer(token);
```

### 4. Execute the Program
Compile and run the program using your preferred IDE or via the command line:

```bash
javac MainProgram.java
java MainProgram
```

## üìù Code Overview

### **Key Methods:**

- **`logonServer(String, String)`**: Authenticates the user and returns a session token.
- **`getQueries(String, String, String)`**: Retrieves queries from the report and saves them to text files.
- **`getFHSQLQuery(String, String, String, String)`**: Handles FHSQL-based queries.
- **`getUniverseQuery(String, String, String, String)`**: Handles Universe-based queries.
- **`logoffServer(String)`**: Logs out from the BO server.

### **Configuration Variables:**

- **`baseURI`**: The base URI for the BO server.
- **`client`**: The OkHttp client used for making HTTP requests.
- **`mediaType`**: The media type set to "application/xml".
- **`filepath`**: The directory where queries are saved.
